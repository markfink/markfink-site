I write about technical topics that interest me (professionally). My focus is on cloud solutions, especially:

* Continuous Integration
* DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

... these are complex topics and even center pieces are (still) evolving quickly. Hence many terms are not (yet) well defined and at times need lengthy explanations. Sometimes people get tired reading lengthy texts and I believe in a superior form of information exchange using visualizations. Consequently I had to use infographics to explain what I am doing.


## Continuous Integration (CI)

## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

SRE shows tremendous synergies with CI in areas like for example automation tools and techniques, preparation & installation of test- and production- environments, and monitoring.
