Today I started working on a new robot. Well, it is not a real robot. TORCS is The Open Racing Car Simulator. No real ecological harm is done except a few electrons are going to be wasted.

My first version of *epic* is very basic. Purpose of this experiment was to setup the toolchain to build a robot driver for TORCS. *epic* is slow and just maxes out the first gear.
