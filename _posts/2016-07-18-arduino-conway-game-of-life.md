I put two LED 16 x 64 LED matrix kits together so I have some "canvas" for a "Game of life" - simulation. Three years ago I programmed a Javascript version during a TDD coaching session and was ever since facinated about how this facinating shapes emerge from simple rules.

I was hoping an Arduino could handle the simulation and it does so very well.
