It is time to get rid of unused stuff I collected over the years.

I am going to continue maintaining the following projects:

* [metrics](https://github.com/markfink/metrics)
* [korg](https://github.com/markfink/korg)
* [whaaaaaat](https://github.com/markfink/whaaaaat)

The transition takes place on 31.12.2019. In case you use any of my code please make sure to download or fork before then.

I wish you all a wonderful XMas time with your families and a great start into a healthy and successful 2020.


Best,
Mark
