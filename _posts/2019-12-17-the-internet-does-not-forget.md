A coworker of mine recently stated at lunch "the internet does not forget". Honestly, I believe this is true. Because of this I am going to cleanup my github account.

I am going to continue maintaining the following projects:

* [metrics](https://github.com/markfink/metrics)
* [korg](https://github.com/markfink/korg)
* [whaaaaaat](https://github.com/markfink/whaaaaat)

I am going to close the [finklabs github account](https://github.com/finklabs) because I closed this company. For the future I am going to keep focusing on the above 3 projects. 
All other projects on the [markfink github account](https://github.com/markfink) I hand over to the internet for remembrance as well.

The transition takes place on 31.12.2019. In case you use any of this consider this a fair warning. Make sure to download or fork before then.

I wish you all a wounderfull XMas time with your families and a great start into a healthy and successful 2020.


Best,
Mark
