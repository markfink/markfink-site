I gave a presentation on Janary 2018 on the topic of "automated AWS deployments". I was invited by Joe Colantonio to take part in the conference and present to the @AutomationGuild members.

I really enjoyed the conference, the presentation and the Q&A session afterwards.

The presentation gives a complete Infrastructure-As-Code example using the **fink tool** to deploy to AWS. Prerequisites and setups like AWS organizations and multi-account setup are explained.

I hope this presentation is helpful to you.
